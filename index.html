					<h1>About Quism</h1>
					<br>
					<h2>Our mission at Quism is to create a natural hair product alternative for clients that offers the purest ingredients and countless benefits. Quism looks to bring new meaning to form and function in the hair industry. We believe that clients should be able to express their uniqueness, while being able to obtain all the benefits of nature.</h2>

					<div class="ellipsis"></div>
					<br>
					<p>Quism emerged many years ago when it became apparent that although trends are fun, what is really important is healthy beautiful hair. We have all experienced the disappointment of trendy hair products that promise us everything, yet fail to deliver when put to use. Quism looks beyond these fads and brings a healthy focus to the very integrity of hair itself. Through years of research, Quism’s founders have created an inspired product line that is more natural and organic than  all products on the current market. Quism’s ingredients like infused floral water, bioactive botanicals, and crystallized jojoba penetrate deep into the hair shaft to result in moisture, flexibility, and shine, without weight. Clients can see and feel the difference through both salon use and at home.Quism strives to bring the best results to its clients. Simplicity is key. Quism looks and goes far beyond the “pretty package” to ensure the ultimate in health and style. The product line is solely sold in salons and spas because Quism’s founders share a firm belief that proper education is the key to receiving incredible results. Quism believes the transparency of ingredients found in all products for clients' wellbeing, along with the purest products possible, create a lasting relationship built on trust. </p>
